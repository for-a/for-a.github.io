  <p id="ID3"><b>WHY</b><br />
    Archicture is a free discipline. This initial contradiction in terms reflects the ambiguity of the profession: since Corbusier
    defined the future in 1923 (Vers une architecture) we are doomed to execute versions of his profecy, with variable degrees
  of sucess and compliance.</p>
<p id="ID3"><b>TASK</b><br />
  Each guest was invited to solve an architectural problem, part of a larger project. The aim of each participation is to trigger a
  response, and not the solving of the problem. The answer can be another question (a more elaborate obstacle).</p>
<p id="ID3"><b>FORMAT</b><br />
  Each participant is free to utilize any medium of expression (drawing, model, 3d, sketch, text) given that they comply with
  the one page limitation. Further editing of the material and conclusion will be done by FORA.</p>

<p id="ID3"><b>THE MODERN DOGMA</b></p>
<p>The success of Corbusier's war against pre-established architectural
  canon, has transformed itself in a new dogma.
  After 90 years of preaching, modern architecture is finally a
  ready-to-consume product. Its supremacy hasn't been shaken
  by the sucessive waves of contestation (teamX in the 60's,
  postmodernism in the 80's, deconstructivism in the 90's...).
  The revolution operated on the way buildings are conceived
  proved to be very efective, to the point that it can adapt itself
  to different cultural contexts, and also to evolving social
  organizations. The modern envelope remains as a very powerfull
  tool.</p>
<p>Our aim is not to confront the modern dogma, but to question
  the notion of dwelling in a context that has greatly changed in
  the last decade. The border between the private and public
  domain, where architecture played a decisive role since the
  begining of times, has eroded with the increasing power of
  the digital social networks.<br />
  This is a amazing oportunity to dissect architecture as space
  defining medium.
  At the scale of a House, one can identify 5 possible pre-concepcions
  / obstacles:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p id="ID3"><b>1 - WINDOW</b></p>
  <p id="ID1"><em>Alex Geroussis+Olka Kiszkielis</em></p>
  <p><img src="5obstacles-of-architecture_window.jpg" width="355" height="279" /></p>
  <p>In the age of internet and the increasing power of social networking
    the architecture of the dwelling seems hard to compete
    with the web. The once revolutionary modernist form now seems
    more like a dogma than an actual need.
    The border between the public and the private domain has been
    corroded and obscured. The user has as much need of the virtual
    as of the real. Where the window presents one view, the internet
    offers a much bigger variety of views pleasures and interactive
    possibilities. The window to the web is one that leads to far more
    private domains of human activity. We suggest a radical architectural
    approach.
    All the private compartments of the building shall be moved
    on the main facade in plain view from the public realm. An
    architectural answer based on the dipole of man both as a voyeur
    and exhibitionist, a human being in need of real interaction and
    intimate contact. In the realm of obscurity architecture promotes
    a vicious circle where the subject becomes the object , the public
    becomes private and vice versa. We suggest an architecture of
    honesty and transparency in an ultimate if not futile attempt to
  stand up to its predecessors.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p id="ID3"><b>2 - DOOR</b></p>
  <p id="ID1"><em>Carolina Sumares + Rik den Heijer</em></p>
  <p><img src="5obstacles-of-architecture_door.jpg" width="577" height="474" /></p>
  <p>The traditional doors of our houses, one                      representative front door and
one functional backdoor, have been complemented by                      new doors. While
our front door might still function as a                      representative of the house
on a local scale, by means of technologies as google                      earth, our houses
are more and more represented by the view from the                      sky. Smartphones
tell us exactly how far we are located from the roof                      of the house we
want to visit. This &ldquo;entrance door&rdquo; from the sky has                      to be designed.
Like the Palm Islands in Dubai, the recognisability                      in google earth is
all that matters.
But all physical doors of our houses are bypassed by                      a digital one
that confuses all hierarchy in privacy and intimacy                      we might want to
implement. Private moments may be shared live all                      around the world and
people in the same physical space don&rsquo;t even have to                      interact with
each other for being socially active. Our                      traditional living spaces
are being contaminated by new doors. How do we deal                      with that?</p>

 <p id="ID3"><strong>5 - FURNITURE</strong></p>
 <p id="ID1"><em>Vassilis Oikonomopoulos</em></p>
 <p>It is both crucial and critical to  think of furniture as an obstacle in relation to the architecture of  a living unit. The critical question is how our perception and  understanding of architecture is challenged by the existence of  furniture and the crucial problem is what does furniture really do to  architecture? In an oversimplified past, it was still hard vs soft,  modular vs static, choice vs culture, identity vs homogeneity etc,  based on a logic of binary distinctions. But thinking of it more  intelligently, furniture can be much more interesting and intriguing.  It is architecture-becoming in whatever forms, which means relative  to architecture but also hyperchangeable almost delirious. It can be  obstacles but it can also be accelerators and modifiers, it can be  mediums of continuity and events-positions of fragmentation, it can  measurable and  identifiable or it can be functional/dysfunctional on  a completely separate plane of objectified entities. </p>
<p>Think of furniture as a system,  ultimately within, always imprisoned in the interior. However, its  presence modifies the itnerior productively, it augments and enhances  the relationship to form but also the relationship with function,  which architecture imposes. Thinking of the house as a container with  interior and exterior surfaces, furniture then would have to be some  sort of inner membranes that maintain the adaptability of the total  and reinforce the potentials of its program. As it conveys lived  experience, it becomes highly interactive and by definition adaptive,  containing a kind of endless possibilities that enable it to deform  and resist in the presence of various environmental forces. </p>
<p>Furniture is also safe and habitually  recognisable. It is a habit and as such, it has to be constantly  reinvented. From the point of view of the user, it becomes a  referential point through which to negotiate architectural design. It  also becomes a medium, which functions in rhythms to produce new ways  of experiencing architectural thought. It could be called as a  specific type of portal, as much of a virtuality and an abstraction  as of materialistic reality which we can use in multiple ways to  experiment, comprehend and combine to create effects and produce  events. Moving them and moving around them can explain a whole lot of  a biogrammatic history of lived experience in space. </p>
<p>Furniture, more than visual form and  configuration, is the way we experience the house, how we tend to do  things plus how we habitually reflect upon ourselves. It can provide  a hyperdimensional reality, changing and altering our sense of  orientation, challenging our brain’s ability to find its way around  topologically. It allows to pick up new dynamics as we navigate  through a cognitive representation of existing space, and to  understand the perverse relationship of connectivities in space and  time.</p>
<p>Its positioning disturbs the order. It  creates different orders, more personal and also more abstract, a  kind of orientation in continuous flux, as we customarily connect the  micro spatial configuration of the multi-directional interior to the  generally accepted rules of the shape and coordinates of space as we  understand it. That is its hyperdimensionality, a quality that  produces an excess of effects over determinate spatiality.</p>
<p>Therefore, we could approach furniture  more as a technology and a tool. Not a tool of design, but of brain  power, a node in a wider system of brain functions that determine the  infrastructure of the house, the negotiation of its space and more  importantly, a historical connectivity between matter and action. An  event that triggers reactions and thought processes, stirring up  information in loads, combining senses, tenses and dimensions on  material surfaces. As such they are playful twists that address  existing and future forms and functions, movements and possibilities  and operate as technologies of emerging experiences.</p>

<p id="ID3"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p id="ID1"><em>FORA</em></p>
<p align="left">Conclusion  appears under the shape of a house destined to be inhabited by a  small group: in between the scale of the individual and the  collective building, the new family is defined. Domestic continuity  replaces compartmentalization. The different levels establish a false  hierarchy, adulterated by the programmatic and symbolic occupation of  each platform. An experience of transition and circulation,  simultaneity of actions and program/function. The interior, which  replaces the facade as the representative and mediating element,  still reveals the last traces of a distant everyday life: beds, wc,  steps, table-kitchen, a collective bath tub. The house, has outlived  the context, but maintains with it an infrastructural anchor, out of  prudery and nostalgia.</p>
