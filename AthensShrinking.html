/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

  <h1>Athens Shrinking</h1>
  <p id="ID1"><em>FORA + Aleksandra Kiszkielis, Alexander Geroussis, Vasilis Oikonomopoulos<br /> Competition - Urban Plan - Athens - 2010</em></p>
  <p><img src="athens shrinking 05.jpg" width="559" height="560" /></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>The Ruin</strong><br />
  Urban shrinkage was first experienced in Athens during the 80s and became most obvious in the 90s, where permanent residents and businesses abandoned central areas in favour of suburban life. Buildings and streets were left to decay. In the years that followed, the result was destructive and with time those areas became characterised by social problems. A shadow of their past, areas of historical, architectural and social importance have been turned into the most vulnerable elements of an urban terrain, monstrously expanding further outside.</p>
<p><img src="athens shrinking 01.jpg" width="818" height="326" /></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Urban Voids</strong><br />
    The continuously expanding urbanism towards the outskirts produces holes on the city's centre fabric where phenomena of abandonment and negligence appear. Activating urban voids will transform the amorphous and ambiguous landscape into a renewed condition of urban composition. The aim is to produce a diverse and coherent urban landscape based on the micro-events of history and architectural encounters that the city can generate. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Programming</strong><br />
  From this perspective, the project targets in generating a system which will redefine the urban environment on both micro and macro scale. Micro-scale interventions on the intersections of streets, will allow for the re-utilisation of left-over spaces, old buildings that are abandoned, empty lots, abandoned car-parks and unused spaces. Infusing those spaces with renewed program – squares, rest areas, agricultural plots, open-air theatres, swimming pools and other sites of recreational activities – new forms of territorial cohesion emerge.</p>
